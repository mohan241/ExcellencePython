                <p id="i7">Despite of many reasons provided below (after this section) to learn or inspire you to learn Python
                    programming, the main reasons are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li id="i8">It has extensive community, means that, if any problem gets arise while doing the program in
                        Python or doing any project or whatever you're doing in Python. You can find and get the
                        solution from any where, over the internet because of its large number of community.</li>
                    <li id="i9">Python has a large number of libraries, that helps to cater all your need</li>
                    <li id="i10">Python is a highly flexible language, means that it can be used to develop a program works on
                        multiple purposes</li>
                    <li id="i11">The development speed of a Python program is faster than other languages as it uses less code
                        more productive

                <p id="i13">Python can be used for many purposes, in which these are the list of some common ones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li id="i14">
                        <b>Web Development</b> - Python is increasing its area in the field of web development too.
                        Using
                        Python's famous web framework say Django or Flask, you can write fast and secured Back-end code
                        for your web. From all the web frameworks provided by Python, Django is the most famous and
                        widely used. Also it is highly-scalable. Even Django like full-stack web framework, can be used
                        for front-end too.
                    </li>

                    <li class="mt-2" id="i15"><b>Data Science</b> - Python programming also helps to develop an application that
                        extracts knowledge
                        and insights from both an unstructured and structured data across broad range of applications.
                        Scrapy is one of the most used data science library in Python, used for <b>Data Mining</b>.
                        Now-a-day,
                        web scrapping application are also getting developed by many stealer too, to scrap the things
                        from Internet. Whereas NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow are the three most used data science
                        libraries in Python programming, used for <b> Data Processing and Modeling</b>.</li>

                    <li class="mt-2" id="i16">
                        <b>Machine Learnings</b> - NumPy and SciPy are the two famous libraries that can be used in the

                        Like human learning, that You're or I'm learning the things, machine can also learn using data
                        statistics and whatever you want to provide.
