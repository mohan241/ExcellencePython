                <p>Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum. Guido Van Rossum is a computer programmer from Haarlem,
                    Netherlands. He is known as the creator of Python.</p>

                <p>On Wednesday, 20th February, 1991, Python was first appeared. The first version of Python was Python
                    0.9.0. In this version, Python has functions, classes with inheritance, exception handling, and the
                    core types such as list, str, dict, etc. and some more features.</p>
                <p>
                    On the launch of Python 1.0 in the first month of 1994, new features comes into picture, those were
                    lambda, map, filter, and reduce. Features like this, gives the immediate boost to the language.
                    Later, some more features were added on the launch of newer versions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python was mainly developed as a successor of ABC language. That is, Guido Van Rossum was inspired
                    by ABC of course, and was think to develop his own language. Therefore, Python comes into picture.
                    And the history is, in front of the whole world
                </p>

                <p>
                    But while creating a book, an author takes care of multiple topics from multiple books to cover all
                    the things in efficient way. In similar way, to develop a language too, the developer/creator needs
                    to take care of multiple languages to implement as more features as the language needs to make it
                    more famous and useful. Therefore, here are some of the languages, Python was influenced by:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>ABC</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>Algol-68</li>
                    <li>Modula-3</li>
                    <li>SmallTalk</li>
                    <li>Unix shell</li>
                    <li>other scripting languages</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In all the above programming languages that helps in developing a new language named Python, ABC is
                    the language that is said to be the predecessor of Python.</p>
